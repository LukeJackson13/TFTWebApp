    In Teamfight Tactics (TFT), traits play a crucial role in shaping your team composition and determining its strengths and synergies.
    Traits are special characteristics or affiliations shared by certain champions, and assembling a team with complementary traits can grant powerful bonuses and abilities.<br /><br />

    <span class="purpleBold">Classes and Origins:</span>  Traits are divided into two main categories: classes and origins.
    Classes represent the profession or fighting style of champions, while origins denote their faction or background.
    For example, a champion might belong to the "Assassin" class and the "Ninja" origin.<br /><br />

    <span class="purpleBold">Synergies:</span> When you have multiple champions on the board that share a class or origin, they activate a synergy, granting a bonus effect to your team.
    Synergies can range from increased attack damage to bonus health or even unique abilities.
    Each trait has multiple levels of synergy, with stronger effects unlocked as you field more champions of that trait.<br /><br />

    <span class="purpleBold">Trait Combinations:</span> Some champions belong to multiple classes or origins, allowing them to contribute to multiple synergies simultaneously.
    This adds depth to team-building strategies, as you must balance which traits to prioritize based on the champions available and the overall strategy you're pursuing.<br /><br />

    <span class="purpleBold">Adaptation and Flexibility:</span> The trait system encourages players to adapt their strategies based on the champions they find and the compositions their opponents are building.
    Being flexible and recognizing when to pivot your team's focus can be key to success in TFT.
