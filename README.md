This is my first project a TFT web app. My web app uses data from the popular video game TFT and has web pages for different elements of the game. 
These pages include: a Champions page, an Items page, a Traits page, a Team builder page and pages for each individual champion in the game.

The skills I have shown will building this project are:
•	I have built my project with 4 main layers: Core Layer, Api Layer, Infrastructure Layer and Frontend Layer.
•	I have deserialize Json data about the video game Teamfight Tactics to be used in my webapp 
•	I have used Bootstrap to structure the frontend.
•	Created an API to access data in my database, which is compiled from the Json data on a per-request basis.
•	Utilized Blazor components within my app to break down the structure and logic of the front end into simple parts
•	I have used Levenshtein distance in my ability description parser to find the best match for each @ tag in the description to each variable name type in the champion Json file.
